# Southeast Asia Trade Analysis (2005‚Äì2024)

## Overview
This project analyzes trade patterns for six ASEAN economies **Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore** from 2005 to 2024.

The analysis covers:
- **Trade balance** (% of GDP)
- **Exports vs. Imports** (% of GDP)
- **Long-term average trade performance**
- **Top Movers** changes in trade shares between 2005 and 2024

## Key Visuals
### 1. Trade Balance Trends
![Trade Balance](images/asean6_trade_balance.png)

This graph highlights stark differences in trade performance across the ASEAN6. Singapore consistently maintains a significantly higher trade balance relative to GDP, likely due to its role as a re-export hub and highly open economy (World Bank, 2023). In contrast, Indonesia and the Philippines show relatively modest trade balances, reflecting higher dependence on imports and slower export diversification. Malaysia‚Äôs gradual decline might reflect structural changes in its export mix, while Vietnam shows steady improvement in the 2010s, likely driven by foreign direct investment and manufacturing exports (ADB, 2022). These trends raise questions about each country‚Äôs integration into global value chains and resilience to trade shocks.

## üîé Quick Insights
- Singapore and Malaysia maintain strong positive trade balances throughout the period.
- Vietnam‚Äôs export share grew significantly post-2010, narrowing its import gap.
- The Philippines and Indonesia tend toward more balanced trade shares, with smaller gaps between exports and imports.
- Thailand saw moderate declines in export share but remained positive in trade balance.
